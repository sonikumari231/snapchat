transcribed using the screenplay and/or viewings of the movie to get the di=

<h2>Bee Movie Script</h2>
<pre> =20
 =20
According to all known laws
of aviation,

 =20
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

 =20
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

 =20
The bee, of course, flies anyway

 =20
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

 =20
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

 =20
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

 =20
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

 =20
Ooming!

 =20
Hang on a second.

 =20
Hello?

 =20
- Barry?
- Adam?

 =20
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

 =20
Looking sharp.

 =20
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

 =20
Sorry. I'm excited.

 =20
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

 =20
A perfect report card, all B's.

 =20
Very proud.

 =20
Ma! I got a thing going here.

 =20
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

 =20
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

 =20
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

 =20
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

 =20
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

 =20
Never thought I'd make it.

 =20
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

 =20
Those were awkward.

 =20
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

 =20
You did come back different.

 =20
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

 =20
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

 =20
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

 =20
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

 =20
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

 =20
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

 =20
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

 =20
That's why we don't need vacations.

 =20
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

 =20
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

 =20
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

 =20
Hallelujah!

 =20
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

 =20
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

 =20
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

 =20
...9:15.

 =20
That concludes our ceremonies.

 =20
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

 =20
Will we pick ourjob today?

 =20
I heard it's just orientation.

 =20
Heads up! Here we go.

 =20
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

 =20
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

 =20
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

 =20
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

 =20
This is it!

 =20
Wow.

 =20
Wow.

 =20
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

 =20
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

 =20
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

 =20
Our top-secret formula

 =20
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

 =20
into this soothing sweet syrup

 =20
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

 =20
Honey!

 =20
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

 =20
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

 =20
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

 =20
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

 =20
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

 =20
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

 =20
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

 =20
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

 =20
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

 =20
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

 =20
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

 =20
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

 =20
But choose carefully

 =20
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

 =20
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

 =20
What's the difference?

 =20
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

 =20
in 27 million years.

 =20
So you'll just work us to death?

 =20
We'll sure try.

 =20
Wow! That blew my mind!

 =20
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

 =20
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

 =20
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

 =20
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

 =20
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

 =20
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

 =20
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

 =20
Like what? Give me one example.

 =20
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

 =20
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

 =20
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

 =20
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

 =20
I've never seen them this close.

 =20
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

 =20
Yeah, but some don't come back.

 =20
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

 =20
You guys did great!

 =20
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

 =20
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

 =20
Their day's not planned.

 =20
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

 =20
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

 =20
Right.

 =20
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

 =20
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

 =20
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

 =20
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

 =20
Distant. Distant.

 =20
Look at these two.

 =20
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

 =20
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

 =20
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

 =20
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

 =20
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

 =20
What were you doing during this?

 =20
Trying to alert the authorities.

 =20
I can autograph that.

 =20
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

 =20
Yeah. Gusty.

 =20
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

 =20
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

 =20
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

 =20
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

 =20
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

 =20
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

 =20
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

 =20
Hey, Honex!

 =20
Dad, you surprised me.

 =20
You decide what you're interested in?

 =20
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

 =20
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

 =20
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

 =20
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

 =20
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

 =20
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

 =20
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

 =20
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

 =20
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

 =20
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

 =20
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

 =20
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

 =20
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

 =20
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

 =20
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

 =20
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

 =20
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

 =20
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

 =20
I'm so proud.

 =20
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

 =20
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

 =20
Yeah, right.

 =20
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

 =20
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

 =20
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

 =20
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

 =20
Wow!

 =20
Oouple of newbies?

 =20
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

 =20
Make your choice.

 =20
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

 =20
Oh, my. What's available?

 =20
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

 =20
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

 =20
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

 =20
Wax monkey's always open.

 =20
The Krelman opened up again.

 =20
What happened?

 =20
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

 =20
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

 =20
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

 =20
Oh, this is so hard!

 =20
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

 =20
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

 =20
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

 =20
Barry!

 =20
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

 =20
What happened to you?
Where are you?

 =20
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

 =20
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

 =20
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

 =20
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

 =20
Another call coming in.

 =20
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

 =20
that gets their roses today.

 =20
Hey, guys.

 =20
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

 =20
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

 =20
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

 =20
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

 =20
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

 =20
- Thank you.
- OK.

 =20
You got a rain advisory today,

 =20
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

 =20
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

 =20
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

 =20
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

 =20
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

 =20
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

 =20
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

 =20
All right, launch positions!

 =20
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

 =20
Black and yellow!

 =20
Hello!

 =20
You ready for this, hot shot?

 =20
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

 =20
Wind, check.

 =20
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

 =20
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

 =20
Scared out of my shorts, check.

 =20
OK, ladies,

 =20
let's move it out!

 =20
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

 =20
All of you, drain those flowers!

 =20
Wow! I'm out!

 =20
I can't believe I'm out!

 =20
So blue.

 =20
I feel so fast and free!

 =20
Box kite!

 =20
Wow!

 =20
Flowers!

 =20
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

 =20
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

 =20
Roses!

 =20
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

 =20
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

 =20
That is one nectar collector!

 =20
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

 =20
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

 =20
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

 =20
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

 =20
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

 =20
Oool.

 =20
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

 =20
Oopy that visual.

 =20
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

 =20
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

 =20
Affirmative.

 =20
That was on the line!

 =20
This is the coolest. What is it?

 =20
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

 =20
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

 =20
Yeah, fuzzy.

 =20
Ohemical-y.

 =20
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

 =20
My sweet lord of bees!

 =20
Oandy-brain, get off there!

 =20
Problem!

 =20
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

 =20
Affirmative.

 =20
Very close.

 =20
Gonna hurt.

 =20
Mama's little boy.

 =20
You are way out of position, rookie!

 =20
Ooming in at you like a missile!

 =20
Help me!

 =20
I don't think these are flowers.

 =20
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

 =20
What is this?!

 =20
Match point!

 =20
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

 =20
Yowser!

 =20
Gross.

 =20
There's a bee in the car!

 =20
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

 =20
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

 =20
He's going to sting me!

 =20
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

 =20
He blinked!

 =20
Spray him, Granny!

 =20
What are you doing?!

 =20
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

 =20
I gotta get home.

 =20
Oan't fly in rain.

 =20
Oan't fly in rain.

 =20
Oan't fly in rain.

 =20
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

 =20
Ken, could you close
the window please?

 =20
Ken, could you close
the window please?

 =20
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

 =20
You see? Folds out.

 =20
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

 =20
What was that?

 =20
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

 =20
Drapes!

 =20
That is diabolical.

 =20
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

 =20
What's number one? Star Wars?

 =20
Nah, I don't go for that...

 =20
...kind of stuff.

 =20
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

 =20
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

 =20
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

 =20
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

 =20
I predicted global warming.

 =20
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

 =20
Wait! Stop! Bee!

 =20
Stand back. These are winter boots.

 =20
Wait!

 =20
Don't kill him!

 =20
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

 =20
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

 =20
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

 =20
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

 =20
My brochure!

 =20
There you go, little guy.

 =20
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

 =20
Put that on your resume brochure.

 =20
My whole face could puff up.

 =20
Make it one of your special skills.

 =20
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

 =20
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

 =20
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

 =20
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

 =20
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

 =20
I gotta say something.

 =20
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

 =20
All right, here it goes.

 =20
Nah.

 =20
What would I say?

 =20
I could really get in trouble.

 =20
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

 =20
I can't believe I'm doing this.

 =20
I've got to.

 =20
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

 =20
No. Yes. No.

 =20
Do it. I can't.

 =20
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

 =20
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

 =20
Hi!

 =20
I'm sorry.

 =20
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

 =20
You're talking!

 =20
I'm so sorry.

 =20
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

 =20
But I don't recall going to bed.

 =20
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

 =20
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

 =20
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

 =20
but they were all trying to kill me.

 =20
And if it wasn't for you...

 =20
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

 =20
That was a little weird.

 =20
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

 =20
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

 =20
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

 =20
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

 =20
The talking thing.

 =20
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

 =20
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

 =20
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

 =20
Anyway...

 =20
Oan I...

 =20
...get you something?
- Like what?

 =20
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

 =20
I don't want to put you out.

 =20
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

 =20
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

 =20
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

 =20
Hey, you want rum cake?

 =20
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

 =20
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

 =20
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

 =20
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

 =20
You look great!

 =20
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

 =20
Are you all right?

 =20
No.

 =20
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

 =20
He finally gets there.

 =20
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

 =20
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

 =20
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

 =20
Is that a bee joke?

 =20
That's the kind of stuff we do.

 =20
Yeah, different.

 =20
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

 =20
About work? I don't know.

 =20
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

 =20
I know how you feel.

 =20
- You do?
- Sure.

 =20
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

 =20
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

 =20
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

 =20
Anyway, if you look...

 =20
There's my hive right there. See it?

 =20
You're in Sheep Meadow!

 =20
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

 =20
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

 =20
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

 =20
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

 =20
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

 =20
Just having two cups of coffee!

 =20
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

 =20
Yeah, it's no trouble.

 =20
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

 =20
Are you...?

 =20
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

 =20
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

 =20
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

 =20
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

 =20
Or not.

 =20
OK, Barry.

 =20
And thank you
so much again... for before.

 =20
Oh, that? That was nothing.

 =20
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

 =20
This can't possibly work.

 =20
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

 =20
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

 =20
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

 =20
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

 =20
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

 =20
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

 =20
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

 =20
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

 =20
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

 =20
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

 =20
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

 =20
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.

 =20
- Well...
- Well?

 =20
Well, I met someone.

 =20
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

 =20
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

 =20
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

 =20
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

 =20
I can't get by that face.

 =20
So who is she?

 =20
She's... human.

 =20
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

 =20
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

 =20
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

 =20
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

 =20
We're not dating.

 =20
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

 =20
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

 =20
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

 =20
This is over!

 =20
Eat this.

 =20
This is not over! What was that?

 =20
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

 =20
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

 =20
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

 =20
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

 =20
Sit down!

 =20
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

 =20
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

 =20
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

 =20
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

 =20
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

 =20
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

 =20
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

 =20
There he is. He's in the pool.

 =20
You know what your problem is, Barry?

 =20
I gotta start thinking bee?

 =20
How much longer will this go on?

 =20
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

 =20
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

 =20
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

 =20
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

 =20
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

 =20
Martin, would you talk to him?

 =20
Barry, I'm talking to you!

 =20
You coming?

 =20
Got everything?

 =20
All set!

 =20
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

 =20
Don't be too long.

 =20
Watch this!

 =20
Vanessa!

 =20
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

 =20
He doesn't respond to yelling!

 =20
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

 =20
I'm not listening to this.

 =20
Sorry, I've gotta go.

 =20
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

 =20
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

 =20
Bye.

 =20
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

 =20
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

 =20
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

 =20
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

 =20
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

 =20
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

 =20
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

 =20
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

 =20
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

 =20
You don't have that?

 =20
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

 =20
Oh, my.

 =20
Dumb bees!

 =20
You must want to sting all those jerks.

 =20
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

 =20
So you have to watch your temper.

 =20
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

 =20
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

 =20
Anger, jealousy, lust.

 =20
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

 =20
Yeah.

 =20
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

 =20
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

 =20
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

 =20
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

 =20
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

 =20
You've really got that
down to a science.

 =20
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

 =20
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

 =20
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

 =20
Ray Liotta Private Select?

 =20
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

 =20
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

 =20
You don't have
enough food of your own?

 =20
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

 =20
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

 =20
And it's hard to make it!

 =20
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

 =20
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

 =20
It's just honey, Barry.

 =20
Just what?!

 =20
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

 =20
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

 =20
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

 =20
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

 =20
Hey, Hector.

 =20
- You almost done?
- Almost.

 =20
He is here. I sense it.

 =20
Well, I guess I'll go home now

 =20
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

 =20
You're busted, box boy!

 =20
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

 =20
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

 =20
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

 =20
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

 =20
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

 =20
You're too late! It's ours now!

 =20
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

 =20
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

 =20
Where is the honey coming from?

 =20
Tell me where!

 =20
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

 =20
Orazy person!

 =20
What horrible thing has happened here?

 =20
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

 =20
they're on the road to nowhere!

 =20
Just keep still.

 =20
What? You're not dead?

 =20
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

 =20
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

 =20
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

 =20
I'm going to Tacoma.

 =20
- And you?
- He really is dead.

 =20
All right.

 =20
Uh-oh!

 =20
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

 =20
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

 =20
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

 =20
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

 =20
How much do you people need to see?!

 =20
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

 =20
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.

 =20
But don't kill no more bugs!

 =20
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!

 =20
- You hear something?
- Like what?

 =20
Like tiny screaming.

 =20
Turn off the radio.

 =20
Whassup, bee boy?

 =20
Hey, Blood.

 =20
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

 =20
Wow!

 =20
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

 =20
I mean, that honey's ours.

 =20
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

 =20
It's a close community.

 =20
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

 =20
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

 =20
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

 =20
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

 =20
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

 =20
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

 =20
You got to be kidding me!

 =20
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

 =20
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

 =20
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

 =20
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

 =20
What is this place?

 =20
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

 =20
They are pinheads!

 =20
Pinhead.

 =20
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

 =20
The Thomas 3000!

 =20
Smoker?

 =20
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

 =20
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

 =20
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

 =20
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

 =20
Oh, my!

 =20
What's going on? Are you OK?

 =20
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

 =20
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

 =20
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

 =20
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

 =20
That's a drag queen!

 =20
What is this?

 =20
Oh, no!

 =20
There's hundreds of them!

 =20
Bee honey.

 =20
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

 =20
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.

 =20
Oh, Barry, stop.

 =20
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

 =20
Do these look like rumors?

 =20
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

 =20
How did you get mixed up in this?

 =20
He's been talking to humans.

 =20
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

 =20
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

 =20
Make out? Barry!

 =20
We do not.

 =20
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

 =20
The bees!

 =20
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

 =20
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

 =20
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

 =20
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

 =20
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

 =20
I remember that.

 =20
What right do they have to our honey?

 =20
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

 =20
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

 =20
Sting them where it really hurts.

 =20
In the face! The eye!

 =20
- That would hurt.
- No.

 =20
Up the nose? That's a killer.

 =20
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

 =20
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

 =20
No more bee beards!

 =20
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

 =20
Weather with Storm Stinger.

 =20
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

 =20
And Jeanette Ohung.

 =20
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

 =20
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

 =20
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

 =20
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

 =20
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

 =20
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

 =20
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

 =20
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

 =20
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

 =20
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

 =20
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

 =20
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

 =20
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

 =20
How old are you?

 =20
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

 =20
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

 =20
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

 =20
It's a common name. Next week...

 =20
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

 =20
Next week...

 =20
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

 =20
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

 =20
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

 =20
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

 =20
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

 =20
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

 =20
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

 =20
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

 =20
I'm helping him sue the human race.

 =20
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

 =20
This is Ken.

 =20
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

 =20
Why does he talk again?

 =20
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

 =20
But it's our yogurt night!

 =20
Bye-bye.

 =20
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

 =20
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

 =20
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

 =20
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

 =20
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

 =20
So why are you helping me?

 =20
Bees have good qualities.

 =20
And it takes my mind off the shop.

 =20
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

 =20
Those are great, if you're three.

 =20
And artificial flowers.

 =20
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

 =20
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

 =20
Bees must hate those fake things!

 =20
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

 =20
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

 =20
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

 =20
You sure you want to go through with it?

 =20
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

 =20
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

 =20
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

 =20
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

 =20
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

 =20
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

 =20
It's pretty big, isn't it?

 =20
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

 =20
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

 =20
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

 =20
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

 =20
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

 =20
You boys work on this?

 =20
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

 =20
All right. Oase number 4475,

 =20
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry

 =20
is now in session.

 =20
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

 =20
A privilege.

 =20
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?

 =20
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

 =20
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

 =20
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

 =20
my grandmother was a simple woman.

 =20
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

 =20
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

 =20
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

 =20
just think of what would it mean.

 =20
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

 =20
for the elastic in my britches!

 =20
Talking bee!

 =20
How do we know this isn't some sort of

 =20
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

 =20
They could be using laser beams!

 =20
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

 =20
he could be on steroids!

 =20
Mr. Benson?

 =20
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

 =20
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

 =20
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

 =20
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

 =20
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

 =20
who think they can take it from us

 =20
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

 =20
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

 =20
but everything we are!

 =20
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

 =20
Oall your first witness.

 =20
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.

 =20
I suppose so.

 =20
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

 =20
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

 =20
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

 =20
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

 =20
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

 =20
- No.
- No.

 =20
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

 =20
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

 =20
They're very lovable creatures.

 =20
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

 =20
You mean like this?

 =20
Bears kill bees!

 =20
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

 =20
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

 =20
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

 =20
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

 =20
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.

 =20
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

 =20
No, I haven't.

 =20
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

 =20
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human

 =20
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

 =20
Oh, please.

 =20
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

 =20
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

 =20
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

 =20
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

 =20
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

 =20
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

 =20
Thank you. Thank you.

 =20
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome

 =20
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

 =20
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

 =20
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

 =20
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

 =20
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

 =20
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

 =20
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

 =20
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

 =20
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

 =20
Order! Order, I say!

 =20
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

 =20
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

 =20
I think the jury's on our side.

 =20
Are we doing everything right, legally?

 =20
I'm a florist.

 =20
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

 =20
To a great team!

 =20
Well, hello.

 =20
- Ken!
- Hello.

 =20
I didn't think you were coming.

 =20
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

 =20
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

 =20
Oh, that was lucky.

 =20
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

 =20
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

 =20
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

 =20
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

 =20
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

 =20
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,

 =20
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

 =20
You think I don't see what you're doing?

 =20
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

 =20
Do we?

 =20
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

 =20
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.

 =20
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

 =20
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

 =20
Yeah, you do that.

 =20
Look at that.

 =20
You know, I've just about had it

 =20
with your little mind games.

 =20
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

 =20
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

 =20
A lot of ads.

 =20
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?

 =20
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

 =20
I think something stinks in here!

 =20
I love the smell of flowers.

 =20
How do you like the smell of flames?!

 =20
Not as much.

 =20
Water bug! Not taking sides!

 =20
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

 =20
I've got issues!

 =20
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

 =20
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

 =20
Surf's up, dude!

 =20
Poo water!

 =20
That bowl is gnarly.

 =20
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

 =20
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

 =20
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

 =20
We need to talk!

 =20
He's just a little bee!

 =20
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

 =20
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?

 =20
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

 =20
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

 =20
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

 =20
Goodbye, Ken.

 =20
And for your information,

 =20
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

 =20
I'm sorry about all that.

 =20
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

 =20
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

 =20
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

 =20
Are you OK for the trial?

 =20
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

 =20
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

 =20
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...

 =20
Yeah.

 =20
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

 =20
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

 =20
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

 =20
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.

 =20
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

 =20
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

 =20
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

 =20
What exactly is your relationship

 =20
to that woman?

 =20
We're friends.

 =20
- Good friends?
- Yes.

 =20
How good? Do you live together?

 =20
Wait a minute...

 =20
Are you her little...

 =20
...bedbug?

 =20
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

 =20
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

 =20
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!

 =20
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

 =20
Hold me back!

 =20
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

 =20
He's denouncing bees!

 =20
Don't y'all date your cousins?

 =20
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

 =20
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

 =20
Oh, I'm hit!!

 =20
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

 =20
Order! Order!

 =20
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

 =20
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

 =20
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

 =20
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

 =20
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

 =20
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

 =20
from my heaving buttocks?

 =20
I will have order in this court. Order!

 =20
Order, please!

 =20
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

 =20
took a pointed turn against the bees

 =20
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

 =20
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

 =20
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

 =20
I...

 =20
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

 =20
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

 =20
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

 =20
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

 =20
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

 =20
What was it like to sting someone?

 =20
I can't explain it. It was all...

 =20
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

 =20
All right.

 =20
You think it was all a trap?

 =20
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

 =20
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.

 =20
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

 =20
I don't know.

 =20
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

 =20
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

 =20
Oh, my.

 =20
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

 =20
- Why?
- The smoke.

 =20
Bees don't smoke.

 =20
Right. Bees don't smoke.

 =20
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

 =20
That's it! That's our case!

 =20
It is? It's not over?

 =20
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

 =20
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

 =20
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.

 =20
Mr. Flayman.

 =20
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

 =20
Where is the rest of your team?

 =20
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

 =20
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

 =20
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

 =20
I actually heard a funny story about...

 =20
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

 =20
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

 =20
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

 =20
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

 =20
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

 =20
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

 =20
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

 =20
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

 =20
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

 =20
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

 =20
Show me the smoking gun!

 =20
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

 =20
Here is your smoking gun.

 =20
What is that?

 =20
It's a bee smoker!

 =20
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

 =20
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.

 =20
Look at what has happened

 =20
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

 =20
Is this what nature intended for us?

 =20
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines

 =20
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

 =20
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

 =20
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

 =20
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

 =20
Free the bees! Free the bees!

 =20
Free the bees!

 =20
Free the bees! Free the bees!

 =20
The court finds in favor of the bees!

 =20
Vanessa, we won!

 =20
I knew you could do it! High-five!

 =20
Sorry.

 =20
I'm OK! You know what this means?

 =20
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.

 =20
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

 =20
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.

 =20
You'll regret this.

 =20
Barry, how much honey is out there?

 =20
All right. One at a time.

 =20
Barry, who are you wearing?

 =20
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

 =20
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

 =20
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

 =20
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

 =20
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.

 =20
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

 =20
every last drop.

 =20
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

 =20
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

 =20
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

 =20
Wait for my signal.

 =20
Take him out.

 =20
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

 =20
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

 =20
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

 =20
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

 =20
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

 =20
Oan't breathe.

 =20
Bring it in, boys!

 =20
Hold it right there! Good.

 =20
Tap it.

 =20
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!

 =20
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

 =20
Shut down honey production!

 =20
Stop making honey!

 =20
Turn your key, sir!

 =20
What do we do now?

 =20
Oannonball!

 =20
We're shutting honey production!

 =20
Mission abort.

 =20
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

 =20
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

 =20
Oh, yeah?

 =20
What's going on? Where is everybody?

 =20
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.

 =20
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

 =20
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

 =20
At least we got our honey back.

 =20
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

 =20
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.

 =20
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.

 =20
And now...

 =20
Now I can't.

 =20
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

 =20
I thought their lives would be better!

 =20
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

 =20
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

 =20
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

 =20
What happened here?

 =20
That is not the half of it.

 =20
Oh, no. Oh, my.

 =20
They're all wilting.

 =20
Doesn't look very good, does it?

 =20
No.

 =20
And whose fault do you think that is?

 =20
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

 =20
Bees?

 =20
Specifically, me.

 =20
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

 =20
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

 =20
That's our whole SAT test right there.

 =20
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.

 =20
And then, of course...

 =20
The human species?

 =20
So if there's no more pollination,

 =20
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

 =20
I know this is also partly my fault.

 =20
How about a suicide pact?

 =20
How do we do it?

 =20
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.

 =20
Right, right.

 =20
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.

 =20
I had to open my mouth and talk.

 =20
Vanessa?

 =20
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

 =20
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.

 =20
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

 =20
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

 =20
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

 =20
I know. Me neither.

 =20
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

 =20
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

 =20
Roses!

 =20
Vanessa!

 =20
Roses?!

 =20
Barry?

 =20
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

 =20
Flowers, bees, pollen!

 =20
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

 =20
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?

 =20
Oould you slow down?

 =20
Barry!

 =20
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

 =20
Yes, it kind of is.

 =20
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

 =20
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.

 =20
Actually, it's completely closed down.

 =20
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

 =20
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.

 =20
I don't want to hear it!

 =20
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

 =20
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

 =20
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

 =20
- Bees.
- Park.

 =20
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

 =20
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

 =20
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.

 =20
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

 =20
Security will be tight.

 =20
I have an idea.

 =20
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

 =20
Official floral business. It's real.

 =20
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

 =20
Thank you. It was a gift.

 =20
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.

 =20
How about The Princess and the Pea?

 =20
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

 =20
Yes, I got it.

 =20
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?

 =20
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?

 =20
It goes under the mattresses.

 =20
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

 =20
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

 =20
Let's see what this baby'll do.

 =20
Hey, what are you doing?!

 =20
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...

 =20
...without arousing suspicion.

 =20
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

 =20
Stop! Security.

 =20
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.

 =20
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?

 =20
Would you remove your shoes?

 =20
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.

 =20
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

 =20
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

 =20
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!

 =20
I think this is gonna work.

 =20
It's got to work.

 =20
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.

 =20
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.

 =20
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

 =20
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.

 =20
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.

 =20
Be careful.

 =20
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

 =20
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

 =20
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.

 =20
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.

 =20
Bee!

 =20
Don't freak out! My entire species...

 =20
What are you doing?

 =20
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

 =20
Don't move.

 =20
Oh, Barry.

 =20
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

 =20
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

 =20
And please hurry!

 =20
What happened here?

 =20
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

 =20
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!

 =20
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!

 =20
No one's flying the plane!

 =20
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

 =20
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

 =20
Where's the pilot?

 =20
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.

 =20
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?

 =20
As a matter of fact, there is.

 =20
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.

 =20
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

 =20
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

 =20
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

 =20
I can't fly a plane.

 =20
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

 =20
How hard could it be?

 =20
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

 =20
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

 =20
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

 =20
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

 =20
That's Barry!

 =20
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

 =20
and an incapacitated flight crew.

 =20
Flowers?!

 =20
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

 =20
with absolutely no flight experience.

 =20
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.

 =20
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

 =20
They've done enough damage.

 =20
But isn't he your only hope?

 =20
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

 =20
Their wings are too small...

 =20
Haven't we heard this a million times?

 =20
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."

 =20
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.

 =20
- Stand by.
- We're going live.

 =20
The way we work may be a mystery to you.

 =20
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.

 =20
But let me tell you about a small job.

 =20
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.

 =20
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

 =20
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.

 =20
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.

 =20
We get behind a fellow.

 =20
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!

 =20
Left, right, down, hover.

 =20
- Hover?
- Forget hover.

 =20
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

 =20
Barry, what happened?!

 =20
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

 =20
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!

 =20
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

 =20
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!

 =20
Move out!

 =20
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!

 =20
Don't have to yell.

 =20
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.

 =20
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

 =20
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

 =20
I can't do this!

 =20
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!

 =20
You snap out of it.

 =20
You snap out of it.

 =20
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

 =20
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

 =20
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

 =20
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.

 =20
How is the plane flying?

 =20
I don't know.

 =20
Hello?

 =20
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

 =20
The Pollen Jocks!

 =20
They do get behind a fellow.

 =20
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.

 =20
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.

 =20
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?

 =20
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

 =20
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.

 =20
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

 =20
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

 =20
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

 =20
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

 =20
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

 =20
Bring the nose down.

 =20
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

 =20
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

 =20
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

 =20
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.

 =20
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?

 =20
Affirmative!

 =20
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

 =20
Land on that flower!

 =20
Ready? Full reverse!

 =20
Spin it around!

 =20
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?

 =20
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!

 =20
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

 =20
made of millions of bees!

 =20
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

 =20
Rotate around it.

 =20
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.

 =20
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

 =20
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

 =20
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

 =20
Aim for the center!

 =20
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

 =20
Oome on, already.

 =20
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

 =20
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.

 =20
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

 =20
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

 =20
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.

 =20
Listen, everyone!

 =20
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

 =20
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

 =20
That means this is our last chance.

 =20
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

 =20
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

 =20
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?

 =20
We're bees!

 =20
Keychain!

 =20
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

 =20
Hold on, Barry. Here.

 =20
You've earned this.

 =20
Yeah!

 =20
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

 =20
Oh, yeah.

 =20
That's our Barry.

 =20
Mom! The bees are back!

 =20
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.

 =20
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!

 =20
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?

 =20
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

 =20
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

 =20
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

 =20
I had no idea.

 =20
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

 =20
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

 =20
Sorry I'm late.

 =20
He's a lawyer too?

 =20
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.

 =20
Have a great afternoon!

 =20
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

 =20
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

 =20
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?

 =20
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.

 =20
Thank you, Barry!

 =20
That bee is living my life!

 =20
Let it go, Kenny.

 =20
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.

 =20
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.

 =20
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.

 =20
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.

 =20
- Thinking bee!
- Me?

 =20
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.

 =20
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?

 =20
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!

 =20
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.

 =20
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
